This roadmap outlines the ongoing development of Community Monitor, with a focus on expanding data insights, improving user experience, and enhancing community engagement tools. These enhancements aim to make Community Monitor more effective and valuable for administrators and moderators.
 
## Future Enhancement Ideas
 
### Automated Moderation & Sentiment Analysis
 
- Use AI for automatic detection of inappropriate or harmful content, with configurable moderation levels to suit different community needs.
- Integrate sentiment analysis to gauge member sentiment and flag potentially sensitive topics early on.
 
### Community Health Score
 
- Aggregate key engagement metrics and content quality indicators to produce a Community Health Score, helping admins quickly assess and manage community well-being.
 
### Admin Collaboration Tools
 
- Allow admin teams to collaborate seamlessly with shared notes, content flags, and priorities, streamlining moderation efforts.
 
### Event Detection Alerts
 
- Use machine learning to identify spikes in activity related to specific events, alerting admins to high-interest discussions or potential issues.
