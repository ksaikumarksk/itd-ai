### Overview

<b>Image Gen</b> is a tool designed to simplify the process of creating complex architectural diagrams by generating them from text descriptions.

### Process Flow

1. Provide a text prompt in the question field.
2. Click on "Generate Image" button.
3. The prompt is processed through an LLM (Large Language Model) chain which generates a formatted string.
4. The generated string is converted into a visual diagram using MermaidJS.
5. Preview the output immediately in the interface.
