## FAQ

### Q: How does the system assign issues to employees?

A: The system uses a Skill Set Excel Sheet to match issues with employees who have the required skills. It then recommends these employees for the task.

### Q: What if the recommended employees are not available?

A: If the recommended employees are unavailable, other employees can manually claim issues. This ensures that tasks can still be completed even if the ideal candidates are not available.

### Q: How often is the Skill Set Excel Sheet updated?

A: The Skill Set Excel Sheet is updated quarterly to ensure it reflects the current capabilities of the team. Additionally, employees have the option to update their skill levels as needed, allowing for more frequent updates.

### Q: Can employees update their own skill levels?

A: Yes, employees are encouraged to update their skill levels in the Excel Sheet as they acquire new skills or improve existing ones. This helps keep the system accurate and up-to-date.

### Q: What happens if no one claims an issue?

A: If an issue remains unclaimed for a certain period, it may be escalated to team leads or managers who can then reassign it or adjust its priority as needed.

### Q: How does the system handle urgent issues?

A: Urgent issues are flagged in the system and may be assigned directly by managers or team leads, bypassing the normal recommendation process to ensure quick action.

### Q: Can the system account for an employee's current workload when making recommendations?

A: Yes, the system takes into account an employee's current assigned tasks and workload when making recommendations to avoid overburdening individuals.

### Q: Is there a way to provide feedback on the issue assignments?

A: Yes, employees can provide feedback on assignments through the system. This feedback is used to improve future assignments and update skill assessments if necessary.
