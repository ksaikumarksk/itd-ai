We leverage data from our internal Skill Set Excel Sheet, this system ensures that bugs are efficiently allocated to team members with the highest competency in the required areas.

## How It Works

1. **Bug Reporting**: When a new bug is reported, the system analyzes the issue description.

2. **Skill Evaluation**: The system identifies the key skills required to address the reported bug.

3. **Data Integration**: The system accesses the Skill Set Excel Sheet to retrieve employee skill scores.

4. **Matching Algorithm**: Using the identified required skills and employee skill scores, the system generates a list of suggested employees best suited to handle the bug.

5. **Assignment Options**:
   - Admins can review suggestions and assign the bug to the most appropriate employee.
   - Employees can view suggested bugs that match their skill set and claim them if desired.

6. **Resolution**: The assigned employee works on resolving the bug, utilizing their high-scoring skills in the relevant areas.
