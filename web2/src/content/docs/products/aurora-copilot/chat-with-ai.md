The <b>Chat with AI </b> feature in Aurora Copilot combines real-time assistance with code generation and preview capabilities. This powerful tool provides a streamlined interface for converting AI-generated responses into downloadable text files and viewing code in a live preview.
</div>

## Key Capabilities

- **General Query Resolution**: Get answers to general topics or technical issues with ease.
- **Khoros Documentation Support**: Access precise information from integrated Khoros documentation.
- **External Data Queries**: Obtain responses to broader queries using external data sources.
- **AI-Generated Code Output**: Convert AI-generated code into downloadable files or view it in a live preview.

## How to Use the Chat with AI Feature

### 1. Accessing the Chatbot

Open the **Chat with AI** from the main dashboard. The interface displays a text input on the left for questions and a live code preview on the right.

### 2. Generating Code from AI Responses

Ask the AI to generate a code snippet (e.g., "Generate a React component"). The AI will respond with the requested code.

Use the buttons below the response to:

- **Download as .txt**: Save the code as a text file.
- **View in Preview**: Display the code in the live preview pane.

### 3. Live Code Preview

Inspect and verify the AI-generated code in the live preview pane on the right. The preview updates in real-time as new code is generated.

## Example Query

<div class="example-code">
  "Generate a React component for a button with an onClick handler."
</div>

This query will prompt the AI to create a React component, which you can then preview and download.

<div class="tip-section">
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>Experiment with different phrasings of your queries to get varied code outputs. This can help you explore different coding styles and approaches.</p>
</div>

<!-- ## Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with the Chat with AI feature, try generating some code and exploring the live preview functionality. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. -->
